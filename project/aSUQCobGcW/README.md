# Project Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the recent refactoring process undertaken in the project. The main goal was to enhance code organization and maintainability by breaking down the `main.old.py` file into smaller, more manageable route files under a new `routes` directory in the `backend` folder.

## Refactoring Details
1. **Creation of `routes` Folder**: A new folder named `routes` was created under the `backend` directory to house individual route files.
2. **Route Files**: The functionalities from `main.old.py` were distributed into separate route files:
   - `file_routes.py`: Handles file operations like querying file structure, reading, uploading, and editing files.
   - `screenshot_routes.py`: Manages screenshot-taking functionalities, including standard and side-by-side screenshots.
   - `project_serving_routes.py`: Responsible for serving the project's main page.
   - `privacy_route.py`: Serves the privacy policy document.
   - `github_repo_route.py`: Facilitates reading from GitHub repositories.
3. **Main Application Update**: The `main.old.py` file was updated to use `include_router` for integrating these new route files.

## Benefits
- **Improved Organization**: The new structure enhances code readability and organization.
- **Scalability**: Easier to manage and scale individual components of the project.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies maintenance and updates to specific parts of the application.

## Next Steps
- **Review and Testing**: It's recommended to review the updated files and perform thorough testing.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Continue improving and adding new features as per project requirements.
