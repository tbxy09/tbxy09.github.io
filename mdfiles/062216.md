### Use pip to install wheel files using the full path:

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib

要用全路径不然会当做requirement文件
C:\Python34\Scripts\pip install C:\Python34\Scripts\pygame-1.9.2a0-cp34-none-win_amd64.whl
Without the path the name is seen as a requirement rather than a already-downloaded file. This should work for wheel files that support your current Python architecture. You can verify your architecture with:
产看python平台的类型
C:\Python34\python.exe -c 'import distutils.util; print(distutils.util.get_platform())'
This should print win_amd64. If it prints win32 instead, you have a 32-bit Python binary and need to pick a different wheel.
